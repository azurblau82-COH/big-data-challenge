# big-data-challenge

I created two models, one grid search model, per instructions, and one neural network model.

For the grid search, I only picked half a dozen column because I quickly learned how computational-heavy this analysis is.
Data was split into test and train groups and the optimum gamma and C were determined.
Still, this model was not able to get really high scores.

The neural network model is able to run with all columns. It can reach reasonably high precision but still with fairly high loss.
